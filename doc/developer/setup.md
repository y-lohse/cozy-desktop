# Setting Up a Development Environment

The following commands should work in a Unix shell (Bash or ZSH for example)
and in Windows PowerShell.

## Install requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (unless you prefer to build the cozy-stack yourself)

## Get the code

```
git clone git@github.com:cozy-labs/cozy-desktop.git
cd cozy-desktop
```

## Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

## Build everything

```
yarn build
```
