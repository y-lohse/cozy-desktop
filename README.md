## What is Cozy?

![Cozy Logo](https://raw.github.com/cozy/cozy-setup/gh-pages/assets/images/happycloud.png)

[Cozy](https://cozy.io/) is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private
space.  With it, your web apps and your devices can share data easily,
providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware
where no one profiles you.


## What is Cozy Drive for Desktop?

The Cozy Drive for Desktop application allows to sync the files stored in your
Cozy with your laptop and/or your desktop. It replicates your files on your
hard drive and apply changes you made on them on other synced devices and on
your online Cozy.

## Disclaimer

:warning: Cozy Drive for Desktop is still in beta version. Backup your data before using it!


## Installing & using the application

See the [official documentation](https://docs.cozy.io/en/sync/desktop/).


## Advanced use cases

- [Installing and using the command-line version](doc/usage/cli.md)
- [Synchronizing multiple directories](doc/usage/multi_directory_setup.md)
- [Ignore files](doc/usage/ignore_files.md)
- [Limitations](doc/usage/limitations.md)


## Cozy v2 users

The new Cozy Drive for Desktop application targets the new Cozy stack v3 only.

Maintenance for the old cozy-desktop GUI / CLI (targeting Cozy v2) is still
occuring here. Support requests are definitely welcome, although we're quite
busy with the v3 release.


## GNU/Linux & BSD users

The new Cozy Drive for Desktop application should actually work on Linux and
BSD flavors, although not extensively tested at the moment.
We don't provide packages yet, so you'll have to build and install it by hand.
Packages for major GNU/Linux distributions should come up soon.
